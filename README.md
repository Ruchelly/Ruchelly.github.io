  Portfolio Lab - README.md

* In this lab I built a personal portfolio using html and css only. The 
  information contained in the bio and contact pages as well as the picture
  and title in the main page are not real/accurate. The project has 6 files: 
  		index.html - the Main page
  		bio.html - fictitious self-biography
  		resume.html - resume page
  		contact.html - fictitious contact information
  		index.css - contains the css style of the pages
  		cutepicture.jpg - image used in the main page 

* All work have been correclty implemented

* I did not discuss this lab with anyone

* Hours spent researching (reading material) and completing the assignment: 30 hours
